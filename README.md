# ⚡ Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort  

This repository demonstrates the implementation of three fundamental sorting algorithms:  
- 🔵 **Bubble Sort**  
- 🟡 **Selection Sort**  
- 🟢 **Insertion Sort**  

These algorithms are widely taught in **DSA** courses and interviews to build the foundation for advanced sorting techniques.

## 🔵 1. Bubble Sort  

**📖 Definition:**  
Bubble Sort repeatedly compares **adjacent elements** and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.  



**⏱️ Time Complexity:**

* Best Case: O(n)
* Average Case: O(n²)
* Worst Case: O(n²)

**💾 Space Complexity:** O(1) (in-place)

✅ **Stable** algorithm

---

## 🟡 2. Selection Sort

**📖 Definition:**
Selection Sort finds the **minimum element** from the unsorted part and places it at the beginning.

**⏱️ Time Complexity:**

* Best Case: O(n²)
* Average Case: O(n²)
* Worst Case: O(n²)

**💾 Space Complexity:** O(1)

❌ **Not Stable** algorithm

---

## 🟢 3. Insertion Sort

**📖 Definition:**
Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.

**⏱️ Time Complexity:**

* Best Case: O(n) (already sorted)
* Average Case: O(n²)
* Worst Case: O(n²)

**💾 Space Complexity:** O(1)

✅ **Stable** algorithm

## 📊 Comparison of Algorithms

| Algorithm      | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Space | Stability    |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----- | ------------ |
| 🔵 Bubble Sort | O(n)      | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)  | ✅ Stable     |
| 🟡 Selection   | O(n²)     | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)  | ❌ Not Stable |
| 🟢 Insertion   | O(n)      | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)  | ✅ Stable     |


## 📌 Key Takeaways

* All three are **simple but inefficient** for large datasets.
* Best suited for **small arrays** or **nearly sorted data**.
* Used in **teaching, interviews, and as building blocks** in hybrid algorithms.
